# Persian Army ICO & Battle Smart Contract
## What is a Battle Smart Contract
Battle smart contract is a platform/ecosystem for gaming which is built on top of a decentralized smart contract, allowing anyone to use a Warrior tokens: entities which exists on the Ethereum Network, which can be traded, and entered into events to do battle with other Warrior tokens holders for fun and profit!

### Since now we developed two type of warriors tokens

1. **Persians**: this Token was created in memory of the 300000 Persian Soldiers that fight against the Spartans army in [**Battle of Thermopylae**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Thermopylae)

### Where do I begin ?

You have to be an early investor of one of this armies to have the warrior token. Otherwise you could buy the warrior token on the exchange.
1. **Persians**: ICO is now over, you coud by Persian warrior on the exchange when they will be relased. [**the supply is only 300000 warrior**](https://github.com/Neurone/persians/blob/master/README_Persian.md)

### What is the release Time of the Battle Smart Contract ?

The first battle smart contract will be released very shortly after the ICO completion and will focus on taking the basic functionality of battle rules and providing a simple (non-animated) web based DApp/UI to enable users to test out the battle mechanics.

## Battle Contract Rules

All battle contract will have his rules, we plan to development many type of battle contract with many type of rules

### The first battle contract will be divided in three phases

1. **Troop deployment**: during the phase 1 the competitors will be able to send an arbitrary number of troops to the battlefield. Once deployed on the battlefield the troops cannot be recovered until the end of the phase 2.
2. **Battle outcome**: at this stage, the troops on the battlefield will be counted and the outcome of the battle will be determined according to the rules of the battle contract counting the **Battle Point (BP)** of all the armies. The outcome of the match will determined comparing BP of the factions. The faction that gains the highest number of BP will win the challenge.
3. **Prize awarding**: each participant of the winning faction will receive back all or a fraction of his/her warriors (according to battle smart contract rules). Some warriors could be considered casualties, and they will be locked forever in the smart contract as **dead bodies on the battlefield**. According to the rules each winning participant could receive enemy warriors (tokens of the opposite side) as slaves in proportion to their contribution on the battlefield.

## Future development

We have several ideas to build other battle smart contract in a number of ways. And give many interesting things to warriors token to do! For now we're keeping the scope of the initial release reasonable.

Depending on the outcome of the ICOs, and the future success of the platform we may choose to fund those augmentations a number of ways, such introducing a bet-mechanism for external battle player who want to bet on the outcome of the battle.

Here is a sampling of some of the ideas we have for expansion sometime shortly after initial release:

Additional Battle Smart Contract, with different rules
Team based combat
Special type of warrior tokens with special type of Battle Points
Co-Op play
Additions to your warrior tokens
Ability to customize the warrios deployment on the battle contract, introducing more phase in the battle contract
And much more!
